# Code review 3/22/2020

## Style. 

These are all minor things, but make your code easier to read and more
consistent with each other and with our setup. I'd suggest you use
these in all your code, not just for me. (I made all these changes as
I went through the code, but note them for the future)

* Comments are excellent and super clear.

* Put spacing around all operators; like English, codewithoutspacesishardertoread.

```
emp_f/(emp_f + emp_m) --> emp_f / (emp_f + emp_m)
if shric>9&shric<33 --> if shric > 9 & shric < 33
```

* Minor: you don't need the .dta extensions with save/use/using, they are assumed by stata:

* Use intuitive variable names in loops. In this case, "var" would
be a good choice:

`foreach y in emp_f_share emp_owner_f_share count_f_share {`

In this case:

```
/* loop over regions */
levelsof region, local(levels)
foreach 1 of local levels {
```

A better choice would be:

```
levelsof region, local(regions)

/* loop over the levels of region *
foreach region of local regions {
  .... if region == "`region'"
```

* I renamed the regions `north` -> `hilly` and `central` -> `north`, as that is how they are usually described. (When people say North India, they usually mean the gangetic plain, which is not the furthest north, but vastly more people live there than in the hilly states. I put Maharashtra in the south, seems like I could have gone either way. (Pranit/Udai, open to your corrections on this.)

* I also renamed `north-east` -> `northeast` -- as you noticed, the dash makes this ugly when you start using it as a filename. Choose names that will make coding easy for you, not hard, even if it means going back to the build files and making fixes.

## Stata tips

* After a merge, you can use the _merge variable to keep only matches:

```
/* Get the 2011 PC district code for each shrid */
merge m:1 shrid using $flfp/shrug_pc11_district_key.dta
keep if _merge == 3
drop _merge
```

(This is a little more intuitive for future readers than dropping if a
variable in the using file was missing)

You should always deal with the `_merge` variable right away-- drop or rename it. Keeping it floating around causes confusion and errors later on.

In our case, we never want to keep `_merge == 2` (i.e. in the PCA but not the EC), but sometimes we want the 1s.

* These datasets are enormous. I find it's better to avoid datasets > 1 GB whenever possible because it just slows things down way too much. One way to cut the size is to merge only the variables you need. Currently, we're only using the populations from the population census, so let's just get those:

```
merge m:1 shrid using $flfp/shrug_pc`x'_pca, keepusing(pc*pca_tot_*
pc*sector)
```

* Use the `mi()` function to test missing:

`drop if region` == . --> `drop if mi(region)`

This is a bit nicer because it reads like English and works for both strings and numeric vars.

* I find this a bit risky to do without parentheses:

`replace icat = 1 if shric == 1 | shric == 2 | shric == 9`

In this case the order of operations works out as you expect, but
it's safer and easier to read if you put in some parens: `(shric == 1) | (shric == 2) | (shric == 9)`.

Even more clear and more concise in this case would be: `replace icat =  1 if inlist(shric, 1, 2, 9)`

* This command can be replaced with `inrange()`:

```
if shric > 9 & shric < 33    -->  if inrange(shric, 10, 32)
```

* Given that we are using `region` for North/South, it's not a great
name for the urban/rural variable. I switched it to `sector`.

* The code to set regions is duplicated across multiple files. This part:

```
replace region = "north" if inlist(state_name, "uttarakhand", ...)
```

This is bad coding style because when you need to change one list, you
need to go to the other file and change that list as well. A better
approach would have been to take the same strategy as for the icats --
save a region-state correspondence with 35 rows that map a region to
each state. Then just merge that in to get the region names or
codes. Then if you change the region key in one place, it will get
changed everywhere else.  (I'm leaving as is for now, but going forward, if you're copy-pasting code from one place to another, it usually means there's a better way.)

* `gen str13 region = "."`

Better to use `gen region = ""` -- because then we can test with `if mi(region)`

* Instead of `graph save`, you can specify a graph name by adding e.g. the `name(north_lfp, replace)` option to your `twoway` command. Then with `graph comine` you can just use the graph name, in this case `north_lfp`.

* when saving anything, put it in `$tmp` or `$out` (a global for the files we eventually want to save and export). Don't use the current path (as is currently done in some `graph save` commands, as it clutters the `a/` folder with graphs that you don't want to commit.

## Graphing

* Time series plot (especially with each of the 4 EC years on the X axis) should be lines, not scatters. It's a lot easier to see the slope and changes in the slope when you can see the line segments.

* Try to combine graphs a little more when it's intuitive. For example if you have combined 4 graphs side-by-side in a 2x2 setup, and each graph just shows on time series on the same scale (e.g. 1990 in graph 1, 1998 in graph 2, 2003 in graph 3, etc..), it makes a lot of sense to combine those series' on a single graph. It lets you compare both levels and slopes across years. Let me know if you're not sure how to do this.

## Substance

* I'm going to study these graphs in more detail and with reference to the existing literature. I think they're a good starting point. While I do this, you can start prepping data for thinking about some of our hypotheses.

* Let's start putting together the shift share instrument. We want to decompose the change in female employment share into within-industry and across-industry. We can do this at the national and at the local level.

  * Nationally: For each change in years (e.g. 1990->1998, 1998->2005, etc.), we want to know: (i) how much did female employment change (you already have this in your graphs); (ii) how much would female employment have changed if it remained the same in each sector, but the sector sizes were the only thing that changed. In other words, for the 1990->98 period: you should do the following:

1. Create a `predicted_female_emp` for each `icat` in 1998. This is the total (M+F) employment in each `icat` multiplied by the female share in *1990*. Then add these up across icats. This tells us what female employment would have been if there was no within-sector growth. Then, create the complementary variable which describes what female employment would have been if there was *no* cross-sector growth. In other words, take the `icat` female shares in 1998, and multiply them by the total (M+F) employment in each sector in *1990*. This tells us what FLFP would have been if there had been *no* sectoral change in the economy, and only increased numbers of women in each sector. (Note we could also do this at the `shric` level and may eventually modify the code to do so.)

2. Let's do the same thing using place. In other words, did the *places* with growing female-intensive sectors end up hiring more women overall? e.g. suppose a tobacco-rolling plant appears in a village. These plants typically hire a lot of women. How much do we see the female share rise? (If your view was that cultural factors were the only thing driving FLFP, then you wouldn't expect these economic changes to have an effect at all.)

To do this, we do a step similar to that in #1. First, we calculate the female share for each `icat` nationally in 1998. Then in each *district*, we calculate the female share that we would expect to see in that district just based on its industry composition. e.g. A district that produces a lot of tobacco would have higher female employment, following the same logic above. We are then interested in seeing the slope of the relationship between predicted female share and actual female share. It's also interesting to map the places that have abnormally high and abnormally low female shares.

* I'd also like to start taking a look at female employment data in the SECC. This is a beastly dataset of all the people in India that lives only on our research server (it's a billion observations split across 35 state data files). Working on the research server requires you to work on the Unix command-line and in a text-only editor-- is there one of you who is more or less keen on developing this skill set? It will definitely slow you down a lot at the start, but it's a useful set of skills to have if you're working with huge datasets.

* Lastly, can we get binscatters with female literacy, overall literacy, and sex ratio in the way we have it for SC/STs? All these vars are in the PCAs. Sex ratios are interesting because places with skewed sex ratios may have son preference, or they may be cities that take in a ton of male migrant workers.
